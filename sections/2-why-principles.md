Why Principles Driven?
===============================

1. Setting out to solve a problem
2. Writing down the ideals
3. Transition to the original principles

The Original Principles
-------------------------------

1. Admit that the original principles were flawed
    1. A mix of technical, cultural, and aspirational principles
    2. Were a product of my own perspective at the time.
2. The principles
    1. Education Friendly
        1. Shifted to "Education Focused" in pitches
        2. What does it even mean to be "education friendly"?
    2. Idiomatic Python
        1. We want `ppb` code to look and feel like Python
    3. Object Oriented and Event Driven
        1. Technical oriented.
        2. A place of conflict
    4. Hardware Library Agnostic
        1. This was fully aspirational.
        2. Originally built on pygame, we still don't support multiple hardware 
           libraries.
    5. Fun
        1. Was added later.
3. Good enough for a solo project
4. A Second Maintainer? And a Third?!
    1. Arguments about system design
        1. "The constraints make this really hard"
    2. Conflict about trajectory
        1. Our roadmap is ambitious, choosing what to do next matters
        2. Our concerns come from various angles.
    3. Explaining _why_ a decision was made
5. The evolution of our principles
    1. We didn't update the README, but we started having a conversation about
       our principles.
        1. These conversations were largely private.
        2. The ideas were tried and discussed with key stakeholders in our
           discord.
    2. We made calls on accepting, requesting modification, or denying PRs
       based on these unwritten principles.
    3. We decided we needed to synthesize all of our principles somewhere
6. Writing the Principles and Values documentation.
