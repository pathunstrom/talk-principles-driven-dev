Principles Now
===============================

1. I set out to synthesize those documents
2. Done as part of our push for `ppb v0.8.0`
3. Transition

The Principles
-------------------------------

1. Students and Learners first.
    1. This is much more clear expression of "education friendly"
    2. We explicitly recognize learners with alternative paths.
    3. We're not exclusively focused on education.
        1. Input comes from learners, teacher, hobbyist game devs, and the core 
           dev team.
    4. Progressive revelation of complexity
    5. No apologies
2. Creativity without Limits
    1. The only limitation we're accepting for the skill cap with ppb
       are the limitations we accept by picking Python.
    2. Code first
        1. Explanation of why this matters
    3. Support all users
3. Fun
    1. This is the principle that guides our API design
    2. ppb should be delightful to use
    3. Designed to encourage playful experimentation
    4. Community focused
4. Radical Acceptance
    1. Recognize that as a living project, change is critical
    2. Diversity of input
    3. Inclusion
