A loose outline of this talk:

1. Introduction on the project and it’s history.
2. Realizing we needed strong design principles.
    1. Covering the original core principles of the project
        1. Note that these principles were largely technical in nature.
        2. Discuss why they helped and why the project out grew them.
    2. Outgrowing them
    3. Answering why
3. The new principles and what they mean for us
    1. Students and Learners first.
    2. Creativity without Limits
    3. Fun
    4. Radical Acceptance
4. Conclusion

I’ve spent the last four and a half years heading up this project and putting
its design principles through their paces: By giving game making tutorials at
conferences and meetups, building things in the project, and getting other users
on it. This talk is an attempt to share all of the things I’ve learned over that
time so others can use those principles in their own work.
