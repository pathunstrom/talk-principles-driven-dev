2. The problem with leading open source
    1. Transition
        1. First project I open sourced
        2. 
    1. What am I even doing here? - ppb background  -- 2 min
        1. Personal project (bitly link to history thread?)
            * PyWeek
            * Pygame boilerplate
            * Public availability
        2. Can you make this better for the classroom?
    2. Life as a Solo Dev  -- 2min
        1. Crushing failure
            * v0.1 and v0.2 were BAD
            * v0.3 was the first major overhaul
        2. Learning who my audience was
            * User research is a skill
        3. Where do I get a code review
            1. Other devs
                * Finding a community
                * Just ask
            2. Teachers
    3. The BDFL problem
        1. My first (regular) contributor
            1. Protecting ppb from dying due to my lack of interest
            2. Needed a specific skill set
                * event queue and publication
            3. Jamie had opinions on my tool chains
        2. My co-maintainer
            1. Jamie had been around for a while, but needed maintainer bit to build our CI
3. Part of the solution: Principles Driven Development
    1. Transition
        1. We have a "product"
        2. We have a team
        3. Now we need to work toward our goals.
    1. The Problem Space
        1. Prioritizing our audiences
            1. Students
            2. Teachers
            3. Hobbyists
            4. Conflicting access needs
        2. Communicating why
            1. Frequently explaining _why_ we couldn't take the easy way out
            2. Expressing what and why our priorities were what they were.
        3. Figuring out what our next priority even was.
    2. Developing a Principled Stance
        1. Origins in README
        2. We would discuss our ideas with each other
            1. We often would forget them
        3. Writing it down
            1. Collecting ideas
                1. What's important?
                2. Who is it improtant for?
                3. Is it actionable?
            2. Discussing the implications
                1. Dig into how a potential principle affects us
                    1. As a community
                    2. As a development team
                    3. As individuals
            3. Organizing them
                1. Outlines and hierarchies
            4. Writing them out
                1. Put them in your docs
                2. They are a living document
                3. Cite them!
                    * Useless if you don't live them.
4. Conclusion
