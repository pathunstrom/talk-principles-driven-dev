3. Part of the solution: Principles Driven Development
    1. Where it started
        1. Frequently explaining _why_ we couldn't take the easy way out
        2. Expressing what and why our priorities were what they were.
        3. Figuring out our next priority even was.
        4. Conflicting access needs
    2. The Unwritten Principles
        1. Solid foundation, but no record
        2. Deciding it was time to write them out.
    3. Writing It Down
4. How it gets used
    1. We reject ideas for being against principles.
    2. When we are choosing between two equally valid approaches.
        1. Use case matters!
        2. We ask our end users
    3. When deciding between conflicting approaches
        1. Our principles define our audience priorities
